Named ports: Service ports must be named.

The port names must be of the form `protocol`-`suffix` with _grpc_, _http_, _http2_, _https_, _mongo_, _redis_, _tcp_, _tls_ or _udp_ as the `protocol` in order to take advantage of Istioâ€™s routing features.

For example, `name: http2-foo` or `name: http` are valid port names, but `name: http2foo` is not. If the port name does not begin with a recognized prefix or if the port is unnamed, traffic on the port will be treated as plain TCP traffic (unless the port explicitly uses Protocol: UDP to signify a UDP port).
